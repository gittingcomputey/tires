Q: How do I know if my tires need to be replaced?
A: You should visually inspect your tires regularly for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks, bulges, or uneven tread wear. Additionally, if you notice any vibrations, thumping sounds, or a loss of handling and traction, these could also indicate that your tires need to be replaced.

Q: How often should I rotate my tires?
A: It is recommended that you rotate your tires every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. This helps ensure even wear and prolongs the life of your tires.

Q: What is the proper air pressure for my tires?
A: The proper air pressure for your tires can usually be found in your vehicle's owner's manual or on a sticker located on the driver's side door jamb. It's important to check your tire pressure regularly, as underinflated or overinflated tires can cause handling and safety issues.

Q: How long do tires typically last?
A: The lifespan of a tire can vary depending on a number of factors, such as driving conditions, frequency of use, and maintenance. In general, most tires can last between 25,000 and 50,000 miles.

Q: What is considered normal wear and tear for tires?
A: Normal wear and tear for tires include gradual tread wear and minor cracking on the sidewalls. However, if you notice any significant damage, such as deep cuts, punctures, or bulges, this should be addressed immediately.

Q: Can I repair a punctured tire or should I replace it?
A: It depends on the severity and location of the puncture. If the puncture is in the tread area and not too large, it can typically be repaired. However, if the puncture is in the sidewall or the tire has been driven on while flat, the tire should be replaced.

Q: Should I replace all four tires at once?
A: It's recommended that you replace all four tires at once, as mixing new and worn tires can cause handling and safety issues. However, if your tires are relatively new and only one tire needs to be replaced due to damage, it's usually acceptable to replace just the damaged tire.

Q: How can I make my tires last longer?
A: Regular maintenance, such as proper inflation, tire rotations, and wheel alignments, can help prolong the life of your tires. Additionally, avoiding harsh driving conditions, such as excessive speeds, hard braking, and rough terrain, can also help extend the life of your tires.
